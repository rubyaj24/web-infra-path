# AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
This repository is a learning resource for understanding the essential infrastructure needed for SaaS product development. It covers different phases of SaaS development, the tools required at each stage, and includes curated YouTube resources for deeper learning.

## Repository Structure & Learning Path

### Phase-Based Organization
- Each development phase should have its own directory with tools and examples
- Learning materials organized by complexity (beginner → intermediate → advanced)
- Practical examples and configuration templates for each tool

### Documentation Patterns
- Each tool/phase includes: overview, setup instructions, use cases, and YouTube resources
- README files in each directory explain the phase and its importance in SaaS development
- Links to relevant YouTube tutorials and explanations embedded throughout

## SaaS Development Phases

### Planning & Architecture Phase
- System design tools and methodologies
- Database design and architecture planning
- API design and documentation tools
- YouTube resources for system architecture concepts

### Development Phase Tools
- Development frameworks and their ecosystem
- Database setup and ORM configurations  
- API development and testing tools
- Frontend frameworks and state management

### DevOps & Infrastructure Phase
- Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- CI/CD pipeline tools and configurations
- Cloud platform services (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

### Deployment & Scaling Phase
- Load balancing and auto-scaling
- Database optimization and caching
- CDN and performance optimization
- Security and compliance tools

## Learning Resource Integration

### YouTube Link Organization
- Embed relevant tutorial links directly in tool documentation
- Organize by skill level and topic complexity
- Include both theoretical concepts and practical implementations
- Reference specific timestamps for focused learning

### Practical Examples
- Working configuration files for each tool
- Step-by-step setup guides with common pitfalls
- Real-world use case scenarios for SaaS products
- Code samples that demonstrate tool integration

## Key Conventions

### File Naming
- Use descriptive names that indicate the tool and phase: `docker-setup-guide.md`
- Include difficulty level in file names: `kubernetes-beginner-setup.md`
- YouTube playlists named by topic: `youtube-links-database-design.md`

### Documentation Structure
- Each tool guide includes: Purpose, Prerequisites, Setup, Usage, Troubleshooting
- YouTube resources section with categorized links (Theory, Tutorials, Advanced)
- Practical exercises and challenges for hands-on learning

## Important Notes for AI Agents

- Focus on practical, actionable content rather than theoretical overviews
- Always include specific tool versions and compatibility notes
- Prioritize tools and patterns commonly used in modern SaaS development
- Link related tools and show how they work together in the SaaS ecosystem
- Update YouTube links regularly to ensure they remain accessible
